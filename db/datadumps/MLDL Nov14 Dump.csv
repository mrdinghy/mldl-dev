Of late, operators of the ferry have begun to load close to fifty passengers to the detriment of the travelers.
This situation claimed the attention of people of   the nearby towns with fear that the September 2015 experience could be repeated if steps are not taken timely to address the action of the ferry operators.
To appropriately address this concern, the W-DSC has taken the following actions:
1.	Constitute a committee to sensitize people of the district on the capacity of the ferry
2.	Erect a bill board at the crossing point with inscription of the ferry’s loading capacity
3.	Replace operators
These actions are expected to take effect before next structure meeting in September.
Paramount Chief Henry Kenneh leads the committee with two other members. Marie Yeleyon and Peter P.S.Paye.
