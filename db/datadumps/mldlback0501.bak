Mr. Gborzuah accepted the appeal and requested that Mr. Lekpeh identifies the new spot in the presence of the Ganta Community Forum leadership so that he will promptly hire a surveyor to determine the meets and bondsof the new spot.

During the mediation, Mr. Lekpeh admitted selling land to Mrsess Gborzua and Paye but maintained that it was Mr. Paye that took his surveyor to the wrong spot. In counter argument, Paye informed the mediation team that Mr. Lekpeh described the site to him. And it was exactly the spot that he took the surveyors to.\nThe mediation team requested Mr. Edward Lekpeh to suggest the way forward since indeed he was responsible for the miss-understanding.

Double sale of land	County surveyors should be invited to do the demarcation and Mr. Lekpeh be in readiness to give transfer deed to Mr. Gborzua. 	Nine years ago Mr. Edward Lekpeh sold one town lot of low land to Mr. Paye Gborzua in the Hope Village community in Ganta for $14,000LD.For the first three years, Mr. Gborzua lay a cannel to drain water from the land to enable him do garden. Due to some family problems he abandoned the area for some time. During Mr. Gborzua’s absence, Mr.Llekpeh sold the same lot to one Emmanuel Paye.Mr. Paye surveyed the land and planted corner stone bearing his name.\nWhen Mr. Gborzua went to the site after addressing the family problem he was faced with, he surprisingly saw corner stones on his land bearing Mr. Emmanuel Paye’s name.  When contacted by Mr. Gborzua, Mr. Lekpeh   clarified that the second buyer, Mr. Paye did not take the surveyor to the rightful site but could not say whether Mr. Paye will be relocated or his money return. It was at this point that he decided to seek redress through the Ganta Community Forum.	\N	\N	\N	2016-12-04 16:56:42.806088	2016-12-04 16:56:42.806088

The area regularly gets flooded because of the blockage of the water way. In recent time the Muslim within Foya wrote the political group called "Friends of Kpakai" to assist in constructing a culvert that will alleviate the regular flooding and suffering that come with it. Friends of Kpakai in return wrote the City Mayor Office to obtain permit and to solicit their support. The City Mayor Office with no delay also gave Friends of Kpakai the go ahead to do the culvert project. As the project was about to kick off, the Statutory Superintendent issued a stop order on grounds that his office, the county resident engineer office and the county superintendent office were not approached, and some technical aspects have not been taken into consideration. The Statututary Superintendent action of stopping the project has created a divide in views and opinions of the people in the district and subsequently  leading to tension among district residents.

Following this episode, the chairman of the Wee-Gbeyi DSC, Mr. Jefferson Gokor appealed to the Vice President (VP) of Liberia, Amb.Joseph N. Boakia for assistance to reconstruct the ferry. The VP responded with US3, 000-00.The DSC constructed a ferry with capacity to hold 30 passengers.

They are worried over the drawdown of UNMIL who has over the years provided them with technical and logistical assistances. LNFS has repeatedly reported about the lack of fire respond equipment & station in the county leaving the whole county particular Voinjama vulnerable to fire disaster. They recorded over 10 fire incidents which resulted to loss of lives and valuable properties across the county during last dry season.

These communities are located about 35 km from Loguatuo along the Centos river bank where Charles Taylor’s National Patriotic Front of Liberia established its first mayor training base in Gborplay and a subsequent incursion by Nimba Redemption Council(NRC) led by Karpeh Duanyen in the north of the district.\nConsidering the fragility of the region as it relates to the porosity of the border between Liberia and Cote d’ Ivoire, and the scarce presence of security personnel in this region and being cognizance of the fact that some unscrupulous individuals could explore any chaotic situation to unveil their anti-peace   agenda, the Garplay Community Forum deemed it necessary to request MLDL support in logistics and mentorship to mediate this  15 years- old dispute between the people of Loelay and Vayenglay towns.	15	50	\N	\N	4	\N	In order to formalize the understanding reached during the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process as initiated by the joint mediation committee of the Gbelay-Geh DSC and Garplay CF and mentored and supported  by the MLDL program in Garplay  town between the people of Loelay  and Vayenglay  towns, the above- mentioned parties resolved in November 2015  to enter into an agreement (this MOU ) that will consummate the final resolution of the dispute and obligate each party to the terms and conditions of this MOU.	\N	\N	Loelay-Vayenglay	9	556	\N	\N	Joint mediation committee	\N	\N	2016-09-03	Thomas Q.

During the mediation, Mr. Lekpeh admitted selling land to Mrsess Gborzua and Paye but maintained that it was Mr. Paye that took his surveyor to the wrong spot. In counter argument, Paye informed the mediation team that Mr. Lekpeh described the site to him. And it was exactly the spot that he took the surveyors to.\nThe mediation team requested Mr. Edward Lekpeh to suggest the way forward since indeed he was responsible for the miss-understanding. In response, Mr. Lekpeh appealed to Mr. Gborzua to accept a new location because the second buyer had done more development on the spot due to the abandonment of the land by Mr. Gborzuah for a good period of time when he was away for problems as earlier mentioned. Mr. Gborzuah accepted the appeal and requested that Mr. Lekpeh identifies the new spot in the presence of the Ganta Community Forum leadership so that he will promptly hire a surveyor to determine the meets and bonds of the new spot. This request was accepted by Mr. Lekpeh and both are to work out the survey schedule and notify the Ganta Community Forum leadership to be present.	24	54	\N	\N	\N	\N	The mediation team requested Mr. Edward Lekpeh to suggest the way forward since indeed he was responsible for the miss-understanding.

Due to some family problems he abandoned the area for some time. During Mr. Gborzua’s absence, Mr.Llekpeh sold the same lot to one Emmanuel Paye.Mr. Paye surveyed the land and planted corner stone bearing his name.\nWhen Mr. Gborzua went to the site after addressing the family problem he was faced with, he surprisingly saw corner stones on his land bearing Mr. Emmanuel Paye’s name.  When contacted by Mr. Gborzua, Mr. Lekpeh   clarified that the second buyer, Mr. Paye did not take the surveyor to the rightful site but could not say whether Mr. Paye will be relocated or his money return. It was at this point that he decided to seek redress through the Ganta Community Forum.	CF	2015-12-04
